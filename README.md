# 📘 Day 3: Linear Regression – From Scratch vs Scikit-learn

As part of my 10-Day Machine Learning Challenge, I explored **Linear Regression**, one of the most fundamental algorithms in ML.

---

## 🔍 Objective

- Implement Linear Regression **from scratch using NumPy**
- Compare performance with **scikit-learn’s implementation**
- Evaluate models using **RMSE** and **R² Score**
- Visualize **Predicted vs Actual** values using `matplotlib`
- Use the **Boston Housing Dataset** to predict house prices based on average number of rooms




## 📈 Dataset

- **Boston Housing Dataset**
- Features: We used only the `RM` feature (average number of rooms per dwelling)
- Target: `MEDV` (median house value in $1000s)
